A place for me to learn and practice any language I've dabbled in or want to dabble in. This is not a place for projects, purely
a place to play around with algorithms, concepts or just language features in a controlled environment.

Each language folder is broken down into several parts
- Common Algorithm Problems
- Coding Katas
- Language Features
- Language Specific frameworks
